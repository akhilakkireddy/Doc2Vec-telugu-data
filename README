Procedure:

-> Train the model:
	python make_doc2vec_model.py
	This generates model.tel file where the model is saved.
-> Write trained vectors to a file:
	python vector.py
	This generates onlyVectors.txt where vectors for each document 	are generated.
-> [optional]  Visualise song and it's vector:
	python vector+song.py
	This generates vector+song+visualise.txt where song and it's corresponding vector can be visualised.
-> convert to Format suitable to classifier in matlab:
	python vec2CF.py
	This generates the file trainInput.txt which is a input to the 	classifier for training.
